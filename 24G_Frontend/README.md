# What I learned:

I learned importing images through CSS instead of through Javascript for ease of use with responsive design. I also learned more about working with components in React and how to give access to data across components.

# Difficulties I encountered:

The main difficulties I encountered was determining which HTML element would allow for scrolling in the popup view. It still doesn't fully work but I didn't want to go over the mentioned time limit to make the project "perfect".

# Final Notes:

I didn't fully complete the project as you will notice, there are small inconsistencies with the example and the final outcome, this includes how clean the scrolling is when the pop up is open, the pop up size scaling with the screen size/device type, and the spacing of some objects within the website is not perfect. I am sure there are other small things but these are the notable ones. Thank you for this opportunity. Have a great day!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
